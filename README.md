## Description
RC Web Programming Practical Collection Repository is a digital platform specifically designed to collect all practicum assignments and projects related to web programming in the Remote Campus (RC) learning environment. This repository functions as a storage center that allows students to submit their assignments according to a set schedule.

In this repository, each practical assignment has a clearly organized structure. There are directories or folders that represent each topic or module taught in the course. This makes it easy for students to upload their assignments to the appropriate directory and allows teachers or assistants to access and evaluate those assignments.
